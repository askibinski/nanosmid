    <h1>Art and code</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a developer and artist with a technical background in
      design engineering. Currently, I'm exploring the possibilities of artificial
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      My development skills include: Drupal, PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Gatsby, Node.js and of course HTML/CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an artist, I'm interested in the intersection of art and technology. This includes generative art, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
